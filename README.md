# Naive Bayes Classification in Java

* The Constructor of NBayes computes all the needed propabilties based on the Training-Set (data[0])
* The function classify uses those propabilties
* The function crossvalidate Computes the Classification-Rate (as positvely classified / number of examples)
* The function printConfusionMatrix prints a confusion Matrix

The Classification-Rate in 100 runs is about 85%.
